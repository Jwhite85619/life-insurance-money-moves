# How Life Insurance can build tax-free wealth

**Overview**
- Permanent life insurance (e.g., Whole Life, Indexed Universal Life) can accumulate cash value that grows tax-deferred.
- Policy loans allow access to cash value without triggering a taxable event when handled correctly.
- Use as a conservative wealth-building tool combined with other investments.

**Quick Steps**
1. Understand the difference: Term vs Permanent insurance.
2. Consider guaranteed and non-guaranteed values (IUL has caps/floors).
3. Model cash-value growth and loan scenarios.
4. Discuss with a licensed agent and tax advisor.
