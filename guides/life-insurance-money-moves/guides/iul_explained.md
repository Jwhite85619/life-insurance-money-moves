# IUL (Indexed Universal Life) Explained - Simple

Indexed Universal Life (IUL) basics:
- Cash value growth tied to an index (e.g., S&P 500) with a floor and cap.
- Flexible premiums and death benefit options.
- Can be used for living benefits: loans, withdrawals, retirement income.

**Caveats**
- Caps, participation rates, and fees matter.
- Not a stock substitute; it's an insurance product with unique trade-offs.
